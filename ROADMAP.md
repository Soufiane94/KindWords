# Kindwords roadmap

## Phase 1 — MVP ✅ done
- Expo project setup (TypeScript), navigation (Home, Settings tabs).
- Onboarding: user picks one or more circumstances (student, worker, parent,
  widow/widower, living alone, patient, religious, other).
- Bundled ~40 sample quotes tagged by circumstance.
- Home screen: a calm card showing a quote matched to the user's
  circumstances, plus an "Another kind word" button.
- No notifications yet — that's Phase 2.

## Phase 2 — Notifications ✅ done
- Settings: frequency (daily, 3x/week, or custom times), quiet hours.
- Local notifications scheduled with matching quotes, rescheduled whenever
  settings are saved or the app opens (so quotes stay fresh).
- Android notification channels (one per lock-screen visibility option,
  since channel visibility can't change after creation) and permission
  handling, including Android 13+'s runtime POST_NOTIFICATIONS prompt.
- Lock-screen visibility setting (show quote text vs. hide it), defaulting
  to hidden since some quotes touch on grief or illness.

## Phase 3 — Calendar events ✅ done
- New "Events" tab: add/edit/delete events with a type (exam, job interview,
  medical appointment, anniversary/grief day, family event, or other).
- A local notification is scheduled the day before and the day after each
  event (fixed at 9am, to keep it simple), with a quote chosen to match the
  event's type. Quotes in `quotes.json` are now tagged with `eventTypes`.
- Event reminders are rescheduled together with the regular ones (same
  cancel-all-then-reschedule approach), and skipped if 9am falls in quiet
  hours or the reminder date has already passed.

## Phase 4 — Polish ✅ done
- Favorites: heart a quote from Home to save it; a new "Favorites" tab lists
  saved quotes (by id, so they always show the current quote text) and lets
  you unsave or share from there too.
- Share a quote as an image: the quote card is captured as a PNG
  (`react-native-view-shot`) and handed to the native share sheet
  (`expo-sharing`). Both add native code, so this needs a new EAS dev-client
  build before it can be tested on-device (see Testing section).
- Themes: four color palettes (Warm/default, Calm, Rose, Dusk) chosen from a
  new "Appearance" section in Settings, applied app-wide via
  `src/theme/ThemeContext.tsx` and persisted locally. Every screen and
  component now reads colors from the active theme instead of hardcoded
  hex values; Dusk is a soft dark mode for evening use.
- Bigger quote library: `quotes.json` grew from ~40 to 80 original quotes,
  tagged the same way as before (circumstances/eventTypes/mood), still no
  attributed authors.

## Phase 5 — AI quotes
- Small serverless backend that calls the Claude API to generate quotes from
  circumstance + event type, with safety guidelines. API key stays
  server-side. App pre-fetches batches and schedules them locally, falling
  back to bundled quotes if offline.

## Phase 6 — iOS and release
- iOS adjustments, app icon, store listings, privacy policy, Play Store
  release.
